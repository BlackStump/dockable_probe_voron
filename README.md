# dockable_probe_voron
This a modified version of [cloakedcode dockable_probe](https://github.com/cloakedcode/klipper/blob/work-annex-probe/docs/Dockable_Probe.md)
The dockable_probe.cfg is the actual config I use on my Voron BUT I have Origin to bed center so the coords may seem off for normal vorons so it is a example only.
